# androidLocationManager
An complete, easy-to-use and reusable LocationManager for Android, using GoogleAPIs.

# Getting start

You can choose any of these two ways to start:

1. Create a project in Android Studio with a **GoogleMaps activity** OR
2. Follow [this tutorial](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/config) to configure an existing project

Any of them are pretty simple to do. Plus, take [this shorcut](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27609442/how-to-get-the-sha1-fingerprint-certificate-in-android-studio-for-debug-mode) to get your SHA1 fingerprint easily.

**ATTENTION:** don't forget to activate your api key at google developers console after create it! If not, the service will not work.
